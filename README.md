# Simple Calculator App

This is a straightforward command-line calculator I built to handle basic math operations like:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
- Exponentiation (^)

### Why I Built This
I wanted a simple yet functional calculator that I could use directly in the terminal. It’s designed to be easy to use, with clear instructions and error handling for things like invalid inputs or dividing by zero.

### Features
- User-friendly and interactive interface.
- Handles common math operations with ease.
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- Easily extendable if I decide to add more features in the future.

Just run it in Python, follow the prompts, and you’re good to go.
